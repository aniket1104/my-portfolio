              Hello! My name is <span>Aniket</span> and I am a web developer
              with skills in front-end and back-end development. I have
              experience in building and maintaining web applications. Prior to
              the commencement of my undergraduate career in 2020, I developed
              an interest in web development, which has since been my area of
              specialization.

              I only recently learned about Web3 and Blockchain and thought it
              was amazing. I am now delving deeply into it. I also have a good
              problem solving skill. I am committed to creating high-quality,
              user-friendly websites and am always looking to learn and improve
              my skills.
